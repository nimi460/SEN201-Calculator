# Simple Calculator System

## Introduction
This project is a Simple Calculator System developed using Python.
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system is designed to perform basic arithmetic calculations.
The user enters two numbers and selects an operation.

### 2. System Design
The system is a console-based Python application.
It collects input from the user and displays the result.

### 3. Implementation
The system is implemented using the Python programming language.
Conditional statements are used to carry out the selected operation.

### 4. Testing
The program was tested with different numerical inputs to ensure correct output.

### 5. Deployment
The system is deployed by uploading the source code to this GitHub repository.

### 6. Maintenance
The system can be updated in the future to include more features and improvements.

## How to Run the Program
Run the `calculator.py` file using Python.
